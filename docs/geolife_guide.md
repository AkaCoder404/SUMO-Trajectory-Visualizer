## 1. Data Description
This GPS trajectory dataset was collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) Geolife project by 182 users in a period of over five years (from April 2007 to  August 2012). A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of  time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. This dataset contains 17,621 trajectories with a total distance of 1,292,951 kilometers  and  a  total  duration  of  50,176  hours.  These  trajectories  were  recorded  by  different  GPS  loggers  and  GPS-phones, and have a  variety of sampling rates.  91.5 percent of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 1~5 seconds or every 5~10 meters per point. 

This dataset recoded a broad range of usersâ€™ outdoor movements, including not only life routines like go home and go to work but  also  some  entertainments  and  sports  activities,  such  as  shopping,  sightseeing,  dining,  hiking,  and  cycling.  This  trajectory dataset  can  be  used  in  many  research  fields,  such  as  mobility  pattern  mining,  user  activity  recognition,  location-based  social networks, location privacy, and location recommendation.  

Although this dataset is wildly distributed in over 30 cities of China and even in some cities located in the USA and Europe, the  majority  of  the  data  was  created  in  Beijing,  China.  Figure  1  plots  the  distribution  (heat  map)  of  this  dataset  in  Beijing.
